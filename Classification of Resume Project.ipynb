analytics The platform comprises three layers a data engagement platform that can easily a ess and manage multiple structured and unstructured data sources an intent assessment and reasoning engine that includes sentiment and predictive analytics and a deep machine learning engine that can sense act and learn over time The project entailed automating responses to user queries at the earliest The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning NLP to handle such queries User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be eliminated Entity Extractor This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like dates names places contact numbers etc This involves Regex Bluemix NLU api s and machine learning using Tensor flow for further learning of new entities Classifier This involves the classifications of classes training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn classifier MNB SVM SGD as Classifier and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best suited response and make the system efficient NER A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text Entities like Roles Skills Organizations can be extracted from raw text RNN LSTM Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities using Keras TensorFlow framework OTHER PROJECTS Title
